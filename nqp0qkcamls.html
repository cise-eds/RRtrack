<div>In the CiSE RR track, we want to promote transparency and rigor, and open peer review has to be a part of that. When requesting reviews, we will tell the potential reviewers that they will have the ability to opt-in to have their identity known to the author. Upon sending a decision letter that requests a revision, we will ask the authors to make a summary of the reviewers' contribution to improving their paper, and include that in an extended acknowledgements section. We will also encourage the reviewers to deposit their review report in an archival repository that assigns a digital object identifier (such as Figshare or Zenodo)</div>
