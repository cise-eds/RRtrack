<div>In our editorial launching the new Reproducible Research Track in CiSE&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Barba_2017}</cite>&nbsp;, we promised to explore a few innovations to the peer-review process. Because we require articles submitted to this track to adhere to practices that safeguard reproducibility, we must review for these aspects deliberately. For each submission, a&nbsp;<i>reproducibility reviewer</i>&nbsp;will be charged with checking availability, quality and usability of digital artifacts (data, code, images). Thi reviewer&nbsp;(sometimes one of the track editors) will be known to the authors, and may interact with the authors during the reviewâ€”for example, opening issues on a code repository. For this service, we ask that the authors recognize the reviewer in the article's acknowledgements section.</div>
