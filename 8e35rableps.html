<div>As editors for the RR track, we will use our judgement and authority to moderate the process, making the extended acknowledgement a condition of acceptance. When reviewers opt in to open identity, we'll provide guidance on using repositories to make an open report. We already require manuscripts submitted to the RR track to deposit a pre-print, which coupled with open reports will trathe full history of a published article transparent.</div>
